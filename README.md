# Design UI Accessibility

## Deliverables:

1. A HTML page structured to the Accessibility guidelines, Semantic markup and ARIA tags, fx. defined regions, landmarks, aria-name etc.
2. Figma Prototype with a form, accessibility support, focused navigation, contrast and text size requirements.

### HTML Markup

A basic site with semantic HTML Markup, Form and ARIA tags for accessibility.

- Site Regions <header> <nav> <main> <section> <footer> etc. with semantic markup for accessibility and assistive tech.
- Labelled menus
- ARIA tags
- Accessible form with <label> elements linked with an ID attribute to the <input> fields.

A Form prototype in Figma.
- Functioning Figma prototype supporting focus navigation and hover states.
- I used A11y - Color Contrast Checker tool in Figma.
- I used A117 - Focused Order. NB!!! The plugin isn't working as expected, in the prototype the order goes backwards.
I have tried to fix this, but it seems to be a bug in the plugin at the moment.
- Labels for input fields.
- Readable font-sizes and ample spacing.

## Report: Inclusive vs Universal Design

### Accessibility and UX.

Accessibility is the goal to ensure that products support each individual user's need and preferences. ‌In order for designs to result in a pleasant user experience, UX designers need to be understanding of their target audience's specific wants and need as a demographic, not as individuals.

While a good UX design aims to please as many users as possible, meeting the needs and wants of individual users is simply not feasible. The goal is to find the delicate balance between universal and inclusive designs—designs that cater to all and designs that cater to few.

### Universal design.

Universal design is for everyone. Universal design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.

When it comes to universal design, the keyword is accessibility. Accessible design focuses on ensuring no user faces any unnecessary barrier when using the product. It accommodates people of varying cognitive, physical, and technical abilities.

### Inclusive design.

Inclusive design focuses and more people who might be excluded by the status quo. Inclusive design considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and other forms of human difference - which might influence or prevent people from using a product comfortably in the status quo.

For inclusive design, we need to look and consider a multiple and diverse range of perspectives throughout the whole design process, whether it is having a diversity in terms of ethnicity, age, gender on a design team or in user testing.
